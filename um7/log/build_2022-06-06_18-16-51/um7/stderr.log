CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinclude/serial.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "include/serial", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "include/serial"
  with any of the following names:

    include/serialConfig.cmake
    include/serial-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "include/serial" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "include/serial_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "include/serial" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
