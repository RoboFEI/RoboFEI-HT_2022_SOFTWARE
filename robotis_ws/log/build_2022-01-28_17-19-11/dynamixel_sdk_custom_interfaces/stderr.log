CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/robofei/Documents/robotis_ws/build/dynamixel_sdk_custom_interfaces/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/robofei/robotis_ws/build/dynamixel_sdk_custom_interfaces where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/robofei/Documents/robotis_ws/src/DynamixelSDK/dynamixel_sdk_custom_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/robofei/robotis_ws/src/DynamixelSDK/dynamixel_sdk_custom_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
