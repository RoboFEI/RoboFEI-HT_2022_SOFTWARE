CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "rt", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rt" with any of
  the following names:

    rtConfig.cmake
    rt-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "rt_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "rt" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
